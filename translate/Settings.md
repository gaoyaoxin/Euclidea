-Each solution is scored in two types of moves: L (lines) and E (elementary Euclidean constructions). Points are not taken into account.

L counts tool actions: constructing a line, a perpendicular, and so on. E counts moves as if a construction was made with real compass and straightedge. Each advanced tool has its own E cost (see the table below).

The goal is to solve a problem using the minimum number of moves. Each level has L and E goals. They are independent. A lot of problems have universal solution that satisfies both goals. But some problems should be solved twice: one solution to reach L goal and another solution to reach E goal.

You can receive the following stars on each level:

the challenge was solved
the L goal was reached
the E goal was reached
all variants(V) of answer were found

V-stars
If there are several objects satisfying the statement of a problem, you can get a hidden V-star by constructing all the answers (solutions) at the same drawing.Usually this implies some kind of symmetry. You need to guess on what levels it is possible because the presence of a V-star is not shown until you find it. Read the statements carefully.

If your solution is not accepted

Select the Hand tool and try to drag different points. A correct construction should satisfy the statement of the problem for *any* configuration of points and figures.

Check the red points. They are not fixed and can be moved. In general, you do not need to avoid them since some optimal solutions are impossible without red points. But, for example, a midpoint or a tangent point can never be red.

Switch to the Explore mode (the orange button) and take a look how the answer depends on point configuration. Compare this with your solution.

Try to prove that your construction satisfies the statement of the problem. It is not enough if it just visually coincides with the correct answer.
